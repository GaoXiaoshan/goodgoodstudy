# lc 133. Clone Graph [medium]

Given a reference of a node in a **[connected](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connectivity_(graph_theory)#Connected_graph)** undirected graph.

Return a [**deep copy**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_copying#Deep_copy) (clone) of the graph.

Each node in the graph contains a value (`int`) and a list (`List[Node]`) of its neighbors.

```
class Node {
    public int val;
    public List<Node> neighbors;
}
```

 

**Test case format:**

For simplicity, each node's value is the same as the node's index (1-indexed). For example, the first node with `val == 1`, the second node with `val == 2`, and so on. The graph is represented in the test case using an adjacency list.

**An adjacency list** is a collection of unordered **lists** used to represent a finite graph. Each list describes the set of neighbors of a node in the graph.

The given node will always be the first node with `val = 1`. You must return the **copy of the given node** as a reference to the cloned graph.

 

**Example 1:**

<img src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/11/04/133_clone_graph_question.png" alt="img" style="zoom: 33%;" />

```
Input: adjList = [[2,4],[1,3],[2,4],[1,3]]
Output: [[2,4],[1,3],[2,4],[1,3]]
Explanation: There are 4 nodes in the graph.
1st node (val = 1)'s neighbors are 2nd node (val = 2) and 4th node (val = 4).
2nd node (val = 2)'s neighbors are 1st node (val = 1) and 3rd node (val = 3).
3rd node (val = 3)'s neighbors are 2nd node (val = 2) and 4th node (val = 4).
4th node (val = 4)'s neighbors are 1st node (val = 1) and 3rd node (val = 3).
```

**Example 2:**

<img src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/01/07/graph.png" alt="img" style="zoom:100%;" />

```
Input: adjList = [[]]
Output: [[]]
Explanation: Note that the input contains one empty list. The graph consists of only one node with val = 1 and it does not have any neighbors.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: adjList = []
Output: []
Explanation: This an empty graph, it does not have any nodes.
```

**Example 4:**

![img](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/01/07/graph-1.png)

```
Input: adjList = [[2],[1]]
Output: [[2],[1]]
```

 

**Constraints:**

- The number of nodes in the graph is in the range `[0, 100]`.
- `1 <= Node.val <= 100`
- `Node.val` is unique for each node.
- There are no repeated edges and no self-loops in the graph.
- The Graph is connected and all nodes can be visited starting from the given node.



**解题思路：**

这个题就是图的深拷贝，使用BFS遍历图，使用copies = dict() 维持已经拷贝的点，以及 stack=[] 存储需要拷贝的点。对于当前需要拷贝的点，构建对象进行深拷贝，并且取得当前点的邻居点，如果该点没有被拷贝，则创建对象并压入到stack中。



```python
def cloneGraph(self, node: 'Node') -> 'Node':
  if not Node:
    return Node
  copies = {node: Node(node.val)}
  stack = [node]
  while stack:
    cur = stack.pop()
    for neigh in neighbors:
      if not neigh in copies:
        stack.append(neigh)
        copies[neigh] = Node(neigh.val)
      copies[cur].neighbors.append(copies[neigh])
  return copies[node]
```
