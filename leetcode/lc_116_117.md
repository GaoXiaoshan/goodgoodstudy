# 116. Populating Next Right Pointers in Each Node [Medium]



You are given a **perfect binary tree** where all leaves are on the same level, and every parent has two children. The binary tree has the following definition:

```
struct Node {
  int val;
  Node *left;
  Node *right;
  Node *next;
}
```

Populate each next pointer to point to its next right node. If there is no next right node, the next pointer should be set to `NULL`.

Initially, all next pointers are set to `NULL`.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: root = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7]
Output: [1,#,2,3,#,4,5,6,7,#]
Explanation: Given the above perfect binary tree (Figure A), your function should populate each next pointer to point to its next right node, just like in Figure B. The serialized output is in level order as connected by the next pointers, with '#' signifying the end of each level.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: root = []
Output: []
```

 

**Constraints:**

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[0, 2^12 - 1]`.
- `-1000 <= Node.val <= 1000`

 

**Follow-up:**

- You may only use constant extra space.
- The recursive approach is fine. You may assume implicit stack space does not count as extra space for this problem.



**解题思路**

- 递归解题， 对当前root节点，需要完成root.left.next = root.right，然后递归完成左子树和右子树。而同一层，两个不同父节点的节点连接（示例1的节点5和节点6）则需要借助父节点的next属性完成。

- 使用层序遍历完成，层序遍历取得同一层的前一个的节点prev和当前节点cur, prev.next = cur



**递归求解**

```python
def connect(self, root: 'Node') -> 'Node':
  if not root:
    return None
  if root.right:
    root.left.next = root.right
    if root.next:
      root.right.next = root.next.left
    self.connect(root.left)
    self.connect(root.right)
  return root
```



**层序遍历**

```python
 def connect(self, root: 'Node') -> 'Node':
    if not root:
      return None
    tree = [root]
    while tree:
      prev = None
      for _ in range(len(tree)):
        cur = tree.pop(0)
        if prev:
          prev.next = cur
        prev = cur
        if cur.left:
          tree.append(cur.left)
        if cur.right:
          tree.append(cur.right)
    return root
```



#  117. Populating Next Right Pointers in Each Node II

Given a binary tree

```
struct Node {
  int val;
  Node *left;
  Node *right;
  Node *next;
}
```

Populate each next pointer to point to its next right node. If there is no next right node, the next pointer should be set to `NULL`.

Initially, all next pointers are set to `NULL`.

 

**Example 1:**

![img](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/02/15/117_sample.png)

```
Input: root = [1,2,3,4,5,null,7]
Output: [1,#,2,3,#,4,5,7,#]
Explanation: Given the above binary tree (Figure A), your function should populate each next pointer to point to its next right node, just like in Figure B. The serialized output is in level order as connected by the next pointers, with '#' signifying the end of each level.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: root = []
Output: []
```

 

**Constraints:**

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[0, 6000]`.
- `-100 <= Node.val <= 100`



**Follow-up:**

- You may only use constant extra space.

- The recursive approach is fine. You may assume implicit stack space does not count as extra space for this problem.

  

**解题思路**

这里116题中，借用层序遍历进行迭代的方法任然适用。但是不满足题目中 constant extra space。所以需要在现有的层序遍历中进行改动，要记住这个trick。

在实现中需要记录两个节点，一个是当前节点cur，另外是它的子节点child，我们根据child来实现每一层的连接。

```python
def connect(root):
  if not root:
    return
  cur = root
  while cur:
    child = dummy = Node(-1)
    while cur:
      if cur.left:
        child.next = cur.left
        child = child.next
      if cur.right:
        child.next = cur.right
        child = child.next
      cur = cur.next
    cur = dummy.next
  return root

    
```
