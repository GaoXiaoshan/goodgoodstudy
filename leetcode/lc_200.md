# lc_200. Number of Islands [medium]



Given an `m x n` 2D binary grid `grid` which represents a map of `'1'`s (land) and `'0'`s (water), return *the number of islands*.

An **island** is surrounded by water and is formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically. You may assume all four edges of the grid are all surrounded by water.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: grid = [
  ["1","1","1","1","0"],
  ["1","1","0","1","0"],
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["0","0","0","0","0"]
]
Output: 1
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: grid = [
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["0","0","1","0","0"],
  ["0","0","0","1","1"]
]
Output: 3
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `m == grid.length`
- `n == grid[i].length`
- `1 <= m, n <= 300`
- `grid[i][j]` is `'0'` or `'1'`.



**解题思路：**这个题一看就是bfs去搜索1,但是中间有个trick，就是已经visit的是不能再访问的。所以代码将visit的1在grid上做了修改，第二种办法就是建立一个visited数组



```python
class Solution:
  def numIslands(self, grid):
    m, n = len(grid), len(grid[0])
    count = 0
    for i in range(m):
      for j in range(n):
        if grid[i][j] == '1':
          self.dfs(i, j, grid)
          count += 1
    
  def dfs(self, i, j, grid):
    if i < 0 or i >= len(grid) or j < 0 or j >= len(grid[0]) or grid[i][j] != '1':
      return 
    grid[i][j] = '#'
    for x, y in [[1,0], [-1,0], [0,1], [0,-1]]:
      self.dfs(i+x, j+y, grid)
    
```
